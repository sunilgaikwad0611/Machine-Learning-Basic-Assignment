# Machine-Learning-Basic-AssignmentTo extract information from the sample image IELTS-template.jpg, we can use the Google Cloud Vision API, which provides OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities for extracting text from images. We can also use OpenCV, a popular computer vision library in Python, to detect facial expressions and objects in the image.

First, let's set up a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account and enable the Vision API. Then, we can use the Python client library for the Vision API to extract text from the image.

Here's an example code snippet that uses the Google Cloud Vision API to extract text from the image:
Here's an example code snippet that uses the Google Cloud Vision API to extract text from the image:

import io

import os

from google.cloud import vision

from google.cloud.vision import types

# Set up Google Cloud credentials

os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = '/path/to/credentials.json'

# Instantiate a client

client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()

# Read the image file

with io.open('/path/to/image.jpg', 'rb') as image_file:

    content = image_file.read()

# Create an Image object

image = types.Image(content=content)

# Use the Vision API to detect text in the image

response = client.text_detection(image=image)

texts = response.text_annotations

# Print the detected text

for text in texts:

    print('\n"{}"'.format(text.description)) 
    
This code reads the image file, creates an Image object from it, and uses the text_detection() method of the Vision API client to detect text in the image. The detected text is returned as a list of TextAnnotation objects in the response, and we can print the text using a loop. 

To detect facial expressions and objects in the image using OpenCV, we can use various image processing techniques and pre-trained models. Here's an example code snippet that uses the Haar Cascade classifier in OpenCV to detect faces in the image:

import cv2

# Read the image file

img = cv2.imread('/path/to/image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale

gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Load the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection

face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Detect faces in the image

faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)

# Draw rectangles around the detected faces

for (x, y, w, h) in faces:

    cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Display the image with the detected faces

cv2.imshow('image', img)

cv2.waitKey(0)

cv2.destroyAllWindows()

This code reads the image file using OpenCV, converts it to grayscale, and uses the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection. The detectMultiScale() method detects faces in the image, and we can draw rectangles around the detected faces using the rectangle() method. Finally, we can display the image with the detected faces using the imshow() method.

To detect objects in the image, we can use pre-trained models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot Detector) in OpenCV or other machine learning libraries. The process involves training the model on a large dataset of object images and then using it to detect objects in new images.
